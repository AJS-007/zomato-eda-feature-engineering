## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to gain insights into the dataset before making assumptions or building models. The analysis includes:

* **Data Structure Analysis**: Understanding columns, data types, and relationships
* **Missing Value Analysis**: Identifying and handling null or inconsistent values
* **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution analysis of numerical and categorical variables
* **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**: Exploring relationships between ratings, pricing, location, and restaurant attributes
* **Outlier Detection**: Identifying unusual values that could skew analysis
* **Data Validation**: Detecting inconsistencies and potential data quality issues

EDA helped uncover operational insights such as pricing patterns, rating distributions, and location-based trends.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering was performed to enhance the analytical value of the dataset:

* Creation of derived variables to better represent business metrics
* Transformation of categorical variables into model-ready formats
* Scaling and normalization of numerical features where required
* Encoding techniques to prepare data for machine learning algorithms

These engineered features improve interpretability and support predictive modeling or advanced analytics use cases.
